## Planning and Development Process

Recently, many AI models like text-to-speech, text-to-image, image-to-video, generative AI and more has been gaining popularity. 
</br>The models can produce very realistic and surprising results. Hence, I have been very interested in it lately. 
</br>

### Problem-Solving Strategy



### Unsolved problems

> - On mobile, the app does not fit the screen exactly.
> - Code can be refactored and cleaned up. 
> - After bots are chosen, we need to disable the div container.
> - Add more personalities and voices.
